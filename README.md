# Vacuum-cleaner-problem-AI
Developed a simple problem solving reflex agent program in Python for the vacuum-cleaner world problem. This program defines the States, intial state, Actions,sucessor function,goal test and Path Cost. For each possible initial state, the program returns a sequence of actions that leads to the goal state, along with the path cost. Generates two test cases.
